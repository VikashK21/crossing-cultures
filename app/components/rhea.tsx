            <h3 className="font-bold">The Roma in Europe:</h3>
            <div>
                Of the nomadic communities in the world, the Roma or the Romani people are the most
                commonly known. Their population count and distribution are not well-known because their
                inclusion in national censuses is sporadic and inconstant. This is probably because of the long-
                standing discrimination they have faced in Europe, from when they first arrived in the 14th
                century to now. “Foreign”, “Uncivilised”, “Criminal”: The Roma are portrayed as “other” often
                in a bad way. This view leads to discrimination and drives further separation from general people
                (“Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves”: Examining Representations of Roma Culture in 70 Years of
                American Television, Adina Schneeweis and Katherine A. Foss, 2016). In the 15th century, most
                European powers aimed to systematically banish them. Prejudice from media and even policies
                have perpetuated the Romani people’s isolation from mainstream society. The major way they
                were connected to the world was through economic channels (Britannica, The Editors of
                Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024).

                This bigotry stems from their unique rich culture, different from that of European society, that
                the Roma have preserved from the time of their origin. They dress in a distinctive way and look
                very different from the native communities in Europe. They also dress in very distinctive ways
                and practise interesting and often demonised traditions like Tarot, Palmistry etcetera. They pass
                down their stories and culture orally. They have their own language, Romani along with
                distinctive styles of dance (flamenco) and music. Of course, being nomadic for a very long time
                has left its mark on their culture. All of their customs and heritage are influenced by the path the
                Roma have taken through the world. Wherever they travelled, they carried their own culture and
                adapted it to the region they were inhabiting. Widespread opening up of the world has led to
                broadened mindsets which has also led to the Roma reconnecting with the world and sharing
                their culture. Today, we correlate bright colours, flamenco, flowy clothes and long-held
                traditions to Romani people.
            </div>
            <div>
                While they do not occupy a single region, they are now centred in Europe, mainly central Europe
                and the slavic-speaking lands like Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and more.
                However, they did not originate in Europe. The Roma themselves do not have creation myths of

                their own, unlike other ancient cultures. Evidence, mainly linguistic and genetic, trace their
                earliest predecessors to Central India. It is hypothesised that the Romani might have started
                migrating sometime before the seventh century and spent some time first in north-western India
                before leaving the subcontinent through Persia. There is a story in the Shahnameh mentioning an
                Indian ruler gifting “Luri” soldiers to a Persian King in the seventh century. Some think “Luri”
                might be present-day Roma. Likely, the migration proceeded through Armenia and reached the
                Byzantine empire (present-day Turkey and Greece). Migration is not as linear and unified as its
                sounds so there are probably many routes taken and many groups moving along them at different
                times. This path is one that is widely accepted due to the linguistic impact these regions have had
                on Romani, stories passed down orally, preserved culture and beliefs and genetic evidence (From
                India to Europe: Roma History, Project Education of Roma Children in Europe).
            </div>
            <div>
                As mentioned, The Roma carry an ancient rich culture that stems from the origin in India. This
                way of life is unique to the Romani people today because of their distinctive history as nomads.
                Each practice has been touched and influenced by every region to various degrees. This
                influence depends on the nature of their interactions and not on length of stay (From India to
                Europe: Roma History, Project Education of Roma Children in Europe).
            </div>
            <div>
                The following paragraphs try to show how the Roma preserved the Indian culture in their life.
            </div>
            <h4>Linguistic Influence:</h4>
            <div>
                The Roma speak Romani, a language rooted in the Indo-Aryan language. Most northern indian
                vernaculars are also based on it like Hindi, Bengali and others. Romani shares grammatical
                structure, morphosyntactic (changing a word slightly to indicate plurality or gender change)
                potency and core vocabulary with Indian languages. The phrase ‘gelem’ meaning ‘I went’ is the
                same in Bengali, it even matches in tense! ‘Kale bal’ means black hair in both Romani and
                Hindi.
            </div>
            <div>
                The Roma’s migration affected Romani distinctly as well. Numbers in Persian languages and
                Romani sound eerily similar. Their time travelling through the Byzantine empire has seen

                Romani taking many loan words from Greek (‘kokalo - bone’, drom - ‘road’). Romani (‘urya’) is
                also inspired by the Romanian plural ending ‘uri’.<br />
                Romani is a very interesting language with its root language geographically distant and its many
                many influences from around Europe. However it is also easy to tell that wherever the Roma
                journeyed they took a piece of their homeland with them with Romani. (From India to Europe:
                Roma History, Project Education of Roma Children in Europe ; Romani, a Balkan but also
                Indian Language, Kevin Sun)
            </div>
            <h4>Flamenco And Kathak:</h4>

            <div>
                Flamenco, an artform belonging to the Roma, was created by the mixing of many traditional
                dances and music styles. It has Spanish influence and may have Indian roots in kathak, an
                ancient traditional artform of india. Both have very technical footwork, with tapping and fast
                beats. Movement of the arms also echo each other to a degree. Overall, if flamenco is rooted in
                kathak, it has remained celebrated by Romani people for a long time. (Flamenco and Kathak,
                blog post by Kamini, Exploring Link Between Kathak and Flamenco, Taj Zehra, The New
                Indian Express)
            </div>

            <h4>Religion:</h4>

            <div>
                As the Roma migrated through Europe, some adapted, whether by force or not, to the religion of
                the land. Today, there is a diverse range of religions practised by them: Catholicism, Islam and
                Traditional Hinduism. That does not mean that the Romani people have forgotten their root
                culture and the deities they used to worship. God is ‘devel’ in Romani (among other similar
                terms). This is very similar to gods in Hindi- ‘deva’. As worshippers of Devi Kali in ancient
                India, when the Roma adopted other religions, they folded the devi into Catholicism as a saint to
                maintain devotion. Saint Sara e Kali is an amalgamation of Devi Kali and the Earth goddess of
                Greek and Egyption paganism (From East To West, Nicholas Nocturne).
            </div>

            <h4>Society Values (Family Units &amp; Dining Etiquette &amp; Guest expectations):</h4>

            <div>
                Like in India, The Romani put a lot of emphasis on the family unit. This is maybe because as a
                nomadic population with no clear boundaries or national identity, the concept of elders and
                leaders within a community becomes very important. Since Indians have a very strong national

                identity and social contract, the concept of leaders being elders become less important, but
                family units with an emphasis on respect to elders remain significant.
            </div>

            <div>
                Traditional food for the Romani might look a little different from Indian food. An apt
                explanation is the availability of raw materials may have been very different as the Roma
                migrated, so they would have had to adapt cuisine to match the terrain. (The Food Of The Roma,
                Slurrp)
