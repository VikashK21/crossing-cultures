                Diaspora refers to a large group of people, belonging to a certain community (religious, national,
                linguistic etcetera) and living outside their region/country of origin for any reason. The largest
                diaspora in the world is the Desi Diaspora or the Indian Diaspora.

                This is for many reasons, forced and not. The migration of some ancient groups cannot be
                accurately puzzled out. All we can tell is that they would probably follow climate patterns,
                opportunities and sometimes even be forced to relocate.

                Migrations in colonial times were forced or rather coerced. To replace slave labour, colonial
                oppressors came up with something new - indentured labour. Indian labourers were shipped to
                every plantation under British rule. We can accredit this exploitation as the reason for the huge
                Desi Diaspora.

                Post colonial migrations are relatively lesser but no less significant. These were mainly driven by
                education and better job opportunities. People tend to emigrate to further themselves in life
                nowadays.

                As a group, we are going to take up some of these communities on different continents and
                present how they continue to carry their native culture with them like food, religion, language
                and traditions.
